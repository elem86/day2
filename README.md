# Day 2

🎯 Day 2 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧩 Excel data cleaning
Today, I worked with raw, messy data from the FIFA 21 Player Dataset and used Excel to clean and structure it into something usable.

Some challenges I tackled:
- Converting values like €103.5M into usable numbers (103500000)
- Extracting star ratings from cells like "5 ★" into clean numeric values
- Transforming compact notations like "1.6K" into 1600
- Filling empty cells with 0 to preserve consistency

🧹 Focus: Real-world data cleaning using classic Excel functions:
SUBSTITUTE(), VALUE(), LEFT(), FIND(), IF(), and more.

🛠️ Tools used: Excel
📦 Dataset: FIFA 21 (Raw Sofifa Data – via Kaggle)
